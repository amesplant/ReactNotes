# 5. Using the Debugger



## How to Debug

As we've mentioned before, perhaps one of the best things about React Native is that it takes the development experience you're used to on  the web, and brings it all to native development. Things like live  reloading and debugging just work out of the box. Let's take a deeper  dive into some of these features -- first with debugging!

## Summary

What's great about React Native development is that it takes much of  what you're used to from web development and takes it to native  development. Accessing the in-app developer menu allows you to reload  your JavaScript code, debug remotely via Developer Tools, and even  display an in-app inspector. 

### To Debug

All you have to do is shake your phone, or press:

- ⌘D in the iOS simulator
- ⌘M in the Android simulator

### To Refresh

To refresh the app, just:

- Double-tap “R” on your keyboard (if using the simulator)
- Shake the phone, then select “Refresh”
