# Project Instructions

1) Use React to build your application’s UI. Remember that  composition is key. It’s rarely a mistake to break a component into  smaller pieces. Look for opportunities to reuse your components. 

2) We recommend using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to generate your submission since it's the easiest way to ensure you  have everything the project reviewer will need to install and run your  app.

3) By walking through the Planning Stage and the Coding Stage of the  Chirper Project, we’ve given you a useful template for building Redux  applications. We recommend using this template for building your “Would  You Rather?” Project. Remember that planning your project and its  architecture before starting to code will save you a lot of debugging  time later on!

4) Use Redux to manage your application state. For this application,  most of the application’s state should be managed by Redux. You may use  component state to handle form input fields and controlled components.  Otherwise, the rest of the state for your application should be  controlled by your reducers.

5) While the focus (and specification) of this project is based on  functionality rather than styling, please ensure that your app is  presentable and easy to navigate.

6) Please carefully test your app against the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view) to make sure *all* of the rubric requirements are met. Your project must meet all of the rubric criteria in order to pass.



# Step 1

Before submitting, please verify that your project:

1. Meets specification according to the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view).
2. Includes all of the files necessary to install and launch your web  application on a local web server. For files that include JSX, please  refrain from using the `.jsx` extension (you can prefer `.js`). You can assume that your reviewer will have npm installed on their machine.
3. Adheres to our [HTML](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html), [CSS](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html), [JavaScript](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html), and [Git](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) style guidelines.

# Step 2

If you choose to develop your project in your Workspace, you can  submit directly from your Workspace. When you're ready to submit, just  click the "Submit Project" button.

If you choose to develop on your local machine, you will need to:

1. Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch.
2. On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub"
3. Select the repository for this project (you may need to connect your GitHub account first).



# Sample Project

We encourage you to get creative with your projects by adding  additional functionality and/or styling (after you've ensured that the  project meets all of the specifications in the rubric)! Here's an  example:
