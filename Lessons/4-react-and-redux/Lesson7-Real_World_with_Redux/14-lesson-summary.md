#### Lesson Challenge

Research suggests being exposed to examples of what we're trying to  learn helps us gain a more in-depth understanding of those concepts and  ideas. Therefore, we strongly recommend for you to go through [these React/Redux sample projects](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples) to solidify your understanding of the material and learn different  architectures for building React/Redux apps. Here's an approach to try:

1. Go through each example and see how:
   - the components work together;
   - what information is stored in the store;
   - how the data in the store is modified;
   - how the project is structured.
2. Determine the similarities and the differences between the architecture of the different examples.
3. If you have time, download some of the examples and try changing them to practice your new skills.

Doing this will help you to develop a systematic framework for tackling React/Redux projects. 

Once you're done, share your observations and something that surprised you with your classmates.
