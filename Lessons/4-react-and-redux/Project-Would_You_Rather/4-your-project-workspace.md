## Your Project Workspace

A Workspace is a development environment integrated into the Udacity  Classroom. Your Workspace is backed by a Linux virtual machine (Ubuntu). You have access to a terminal, so you have complete control over  installing packages and modifying content.

Below is what your Workspace will look like:

## Preservation Information

The first time you open your Workspace, a new virtual machine is created just for you. Any files that you modify in `/home/workspace` or any new files you add in `/home/workspace` are automatically backed up and saved. The next time you come back to the Workspace, any previous changes will be preserved.

If you don't interact with the Workspace for 30 minutes, the  Workspace will be suspended. The Workspace becomes idle by any of the  following:

- not interacting with the browser tab of the Workspace
- closing the browser tab with the Workspace
- if your laptop goes to sleep
- etc



### Restoring Your Workspace

If your Workspace has been suspended after a period of inactivity,  just click the "Wake Up Workspace" button to restore it. Remember that  none of your data is lost. 



# Project Development

Think of your Workspace as a normal computer:

- Open up the files you need to edit (saving is done automatically).
- Open terminal windows as necessary.
  - The terminal should start at `/home/workspace`, so make sure to `cd` to the correct directory as necessary.
- Start the project
  - Use Create React App to scaffold your project
  - Move the starter file into your project by right clicking the starter file and selecting a new location for it 
  - `cd` into your project
  - run `npm start`

- To view your project, click the "Open Preview Tab" button located in the lower left of the screen.
  - Running `npm start` causes Create React App to display a URL of `http://localhost:3000/`. Because your Workspace is running in a virtual machine, typing `http://localhost:3000/` into your browser will not access the local host of the VM, so make sure to use the "Open Preview Tab" button.
- To submit your project, click the "Submit Project" button located in the lower right side of the screen.



# Development Choice

We've created this Workspace for you so you can enjoy an integrated  learning experience by staying in the classroom, working on your  project, and submitting directly from here!

You always have the option to develop your project locally, if you choose. 



# Unable to Access Your Workspace?

If you are unable to access your Workspace in the Classroom it could  be because you have "3rd Party Cookies" disabled in your browser.  Workspaces need to set a "3rd party cookie" to enable access.
