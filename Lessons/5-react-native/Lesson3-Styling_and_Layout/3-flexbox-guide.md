## Getting Started with Flexbox

If you aren't familiar with flexbox you're in good company, because I'm not either. That's a joke.

Whenever I learn a new technology, I like to answer the question,  ‚ÄúWhy does this specific technology exist?‚Äù With flexbox, the answer to  this question may just be that creating an all-purpose layout with CSS  can be quite cumbersome. The whole goal of flexbox is to create a more  efficient way to "lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a  container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic". In a  nutshell, flexbox is all about creating dynamic layouts.

The main idea of flexbox is that you give the parent element the ability to control the layout of all of their (*immediate*!) child elements rather than having each child element control its own layout. When you do this, the parent becomes a **flex container** while the child elements become **flex items**. An example of this is instead of having to float to the left all  children of an element and add margin to each one, instead, you can just have the parent element specify to have all of its children be laid out in a row with even space between them. So, layout responsibilities move from the children to the parent. This allows for more fine tuned  control over the layout of your app.

### Flexbox Axes

By far, the most important concept to understand when it comes to flexbox is that flexbox is all about different [axes](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-plural-of-axis). You'll have a **Main Axis** and a **Cross Axis**.



[![Diagram of a phone in portrait mode, with the long axis labeled "Main Axis" and the short axis "Cross Axis".](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b84519_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-1/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-1.jpg)*Flexbox Axes: Main Axis and Cross Axis* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



In React Native, by default, the **Main Axis** is vertical while the **Cross Axis** is horizontal. Everything from here on out is built upon this concept of a **Main Axis** and **Cross Axis**. 

When I say "‚Ä¶which will align all the child elements along the Main  Axis" that means that, by default, all the children of the parent  element will be laid out vertically from top to bottom. If I say "‚Ä¶which will align the child elements along the Cross Axis" that means that, by default, all the children elements will be laid out horizontally from  left to right. 

The rest of flexbox is just deciding how you want to align, position, stretch, spread, shrink, center, wrap child elements along the Main and Cross axis.



### Flex Direction

You'll notice that I was very deliberate in mentioning the "default behavior" when it comes to the **Main Axis** and **Cross Axis**. That's because you can actually change which Axis is Main and which is Cross. That brings us to our first flexbox property, `flex-direction` (or `flexDirection` in React Native).

`flex-direction` has two values:

- `row`
- `column`

By default, every element in React Native has the `flexDirection: column` declaration. When an element has a `flex-direction` of `column`, its *Main* Axis is vertical and its *Cross* Axis is horizontal, just as we saw in the image above. However, if you give an element a `flexDirection: row` declaration, the axes switch. The Main axis becomes horizontal, while  the Cross axis becomes vertical. Again, this is crucial because your  entire layout is dependent on these two axes.



[![Under "flex-direction: row", the main axis is now the horizontal axis, and the cross axis is the vertical axis.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b8454e_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-2/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-2.jpg)*`flex-direction` changes which axis is the **Main** Axis.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



### Justify Content

Now is when things start getting fun. Let's dive into the different  properties and values we can use to align child elements along these  axes. Let's focus entirely on the *Main* Axis, first. 

In order to specify how children align themselves along the Main Axis, you'll use the `justifyContent` property. `justifyContent` has five different values you can use in order to change how the children align themselves along the Main Axis.

- `flex-start`
- `center`
- `flex-end`
- `space-around`
- `space-between`

Woah. I just dropped lots of unfamiliar terms. I'll walk through each and every one of them though, so we're good üíÉüèΩ.

If you want to follow along (which I *highly* recommend you do), create a new React Native project called "FlexboxExamples" and swap out your `App.js` code with the following:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, AppRegistry } from 'react-native'

class FlexboxExamples extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  box: {
    height: 50,
    width: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})

export default FlexboxExamples;
```

Note that with the code above, the only thing we'll be changing is the styling in the `container` object in the `styles` StyleSheet object. Ignore `flex: 1` for now.



#### Justify Content:  Flex-Start



[![Under "justifyContent: flex-start", flex items appear at the beginning of the main axis.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b84595_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-3/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-3.jpg)*`justifyContent: flex-start` makes flex items appear at the beginning of the **Main Axis**.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



`justifyContent: 'flex-start'` will align every child element towards the start of the the Main Axis.

```js
container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'flex-start',
}
```

If you were still struggling with the importance of Main Axis and Cross Axis hopefully it just clicked. Because `flexDirection` defaults to `column`, and we're using `justifyContent` which targets the Main Axis, our child elements are going to align themselves towards the *start* of the Main Axis which is the top left and work their way down.



#### Justify Content: Center



[![Under "justifyContent: center", flex items appear in the center of the main axis.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b845cb_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-4/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-4.jpg)*`justifyContent: center` makes flex items appear in the center of the **Main Axis**.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



`justifyContent: 'center'` will align every child element towards the center of the the Main Axis. 

```js
container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'center',
}
```



#### Justify Content: Flex-End



[![Under "justifyContent: flex-end", flex items appear at the end of the main axis.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b845f0_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-5/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-5.jpg)*`justifyContent: flex-end` makes flex items appear at the end of the **Main Axis**.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



`justifyContent: 'flex-end'` will align every child element towards the end of the the Main Axis. 

```js
container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'flex-end',
}
```



#### Justify Content: Space-Between



[![Under "justifyContent: space-between", flex items appear at both ends of the main axis, with space between the items.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b84617_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-6/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-6.jpg)*`justifyContent: space-between` flex items appear at both ends of the **Main Axis** with space between the items.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



`justifyContent: 'space-between'` will align every child so that the space between each child is even along the Main Axis. 

```js
container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'space-between',
}
```



#### Justify Content: Space-Around



[![Under "justifyContent: space-around", flex items are spaced equidistantly along the main axis.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b8463e_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-7/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-7.jpg)*`justifyContent: space-around` flex items are spaced equidistant along the **Main Axis**.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



`justifyContent: 'space-around'` will align every child element so that there is even space around each element along the Main Axis. 

```js
container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'space-around',
}
```

Now I want you to think about what would happen if we changed the `flexDirection` of our container to `row` instead of the default value `column`? Instead of our Main Axis being vertical, it's going to be horizontal.  That means any child elements are going to align themselves *horizontally* rather than *vertically*.

```js
container: {
  flex: 1,
  flexDirection: 'row',
  justifyContent: 'space-around',
}
```



[![`justifyContent: space-around` with `flex-direction: row` changes the **Main Axis** to be horizontally with space around the flex items.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b8466a_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-8/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-8.jpg)*`justifyContent: space-around` with `flex-direction: row` changes the **Main Axis** to be horizontally with space around the flex items.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



Notice that all we changed was the value for `flexDirection`, and it drastically altered our layout. Now you're starting to see the real power of flexbox.



### Align Items (The Cross Axis)

Now let's turn our focus entirely to the Cross Axis. In order to  specify how children align themselves along the Cross Axis, you'd use  the `align-items` property.

You would think that `alignItems` has the exact same values as `justifyContent`. It's a reasonable guess, but you'd be wrong. This property has four  different values you can use in order to change how the children align  themselves among the Cross Axis.

- `flex-start`
- `center`
- `flex-end`
- `stretch`

#### Align Items - Flex-Start

`alignItems: 'stretch'` will stretch every child element along the Cross Axis as long as the child element does not have a specified height (`flexDirection: row`) or width (`flexDirection: column`). 

```js
container: {
  flex: 1,
  alignItems: 'stretch',
},
box: {
  height: 50,
  backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
  margin: 10,
}
```

Just when you thought you were getting the hang of it, flexbox throws a wrench in your brain. Whenever you set `alignItems` to `stretch`, each child element is going to stretch the full width or height of the parent container **as long as that child element doesn't have a width or a height**. Notice in the box styling, I removed the `width: 50` because `flexDirection` is set to `column` by default meaning that flex items will be stretching horizontally (since we're using `alignItems`).

To cement this home, what will our UI look like if I change our styling to this?

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'stretch',
    flexDirection: 'row',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})
```

Notice I've changed the `flexDirection` to `row`, and I've added back in `width: 50` and removed the `height: 50`.

Let's break this down. First, the Main Axis is now running horizontally since we added `flexDirection: row`. This means that `alignItems` will be aligning the items along the *vertical* axis. Because we've removed the height of the child elements and added `alignItems: stretch`, those elements are going to stretch along the vertical axis for the  entire length of their parent component, which in this case is the whole view.

Up until this point, we've only had one flex container or parent  element. Don't get it twisted though; if you create more nested flex  containers, the exact same logic above is going to be true for those  child elements (flex items) but instead of being relative to the whole  view (as in our example), they'll position themselves according to the  their parent component. Your entire UI will be built upon nesting flex  containers.

At this point, you're essentially a red belt in React Native styling  TaeKwonDo. There are a few other flexbox features we need to look at,  though.

You'll very quickly come to a realization that there are no  percent-based styling in React Native. Though I agree it makes things a  bit more difficult, everything you can do with percent-based styling you can do with flexbox. Remember the `flex: 1` declaration we  used in all the examples above? That's the property that's going to  allow us to do it. Interestingly enough there's no exact comparison for  this feature in flexbox on the web, but it is similar to `flex-grow` if you know what that does.

As we've seen over and over, flexbox is concerned with giving control to the parent element to handle the layout of its children elements.  The `flex` property is a bit different as it allows child  elements to specify their height or width in comparison to their sibling elements. The best way to explain flex is to look at some examples.



#### Centering Content

Let's start off with a view like this:



[![Centering content along both the **Main Axis** and the **Cross Axis**.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b847b5_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-14/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-14.jpg)*Centering content along both the **Main Axis** and the **Cross Axis**.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



How would you implement that? Notice that our Main Axis is horizontal; this gives us a clue that we're using `flexDirection: row`. The boxes are in the center of both axes which means we're using `justifyContent: 'center'` and `alignItems: 'center'`.

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})
```



### The Flex Property

But now, what if we wanted to change our UI to look like this:



[![_Using the `flex` property to change the rate at which a flex items increases its size comparable to other flex items._](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b847ee_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-15/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-15.jpg)*Using the `flex` property to change the rate at which a flex items increases its size comparable to other flex items.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



In the above image, it's exactly the same layout -- but now the middle  section is twice as wide as its siblings! This is what the `flex` property allows us to do. Here‚Äôs the code:

```js
class FlexboxExamples extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={[styles.box, {flex: 1}]}/>
        <View style={[styles.box, {flex: 2}]}/>
        <View style={[styles.box, {flex: 1}]}/>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})

export default FlexboxExamples;
```

Notice I didn't add any styles; I just made the middle sibling have `flex: 2` while the other siblings have `flex: 1`. This basically says "make sure that the middle sibling is twice as  large along the Main Axis as the first and third children". This is the  reason why `flex` can replace percentages because usually a  percent-based layout is just one where specific elements are relative to other elements, exactly like we're doing above. It's also important to  note that if you place `flex: 1` on an element, that element  is going to take up as much space as its parent takes up. That's why in  most of our examples above because we want our "layout area" to be the  size of the parent, which in our examples was the whole viewport.

Let's go even deeper!



### Aligning Individual Flex Items

What if we wanted a layout like this?



[![_`alignSelf: flex-end` changes the flex item it targets to appear at the end of the **Cross Axis**._](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/September/59b8481d_nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-16/nd019-c1-l3-flexbox-16.jpg)*`alignSelf: flex-end` changes the flex item it targets to appear at the end of the **Cross Axis**.* ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019/parts/9b15c3b4-c38a-4fcd-8fe7-47937b293a3a/modules/be422d8e-8927-496d-b203-1868289e90c5/lessons/0d761c28-fb21-432e-a822-f9495ec1b64b/concepts/90f2cd35-dd1a-48a4-a764-cc6e9fec0122#)



It's as if the first and third element are centered both vertically and  horizontally, but that second element has a mind of its own and is using `flex-end` along the Cross Axis. To implement this, we'll  need a way to have the child element override a specific positioning it  received from its parent. Good news: that's exactly what `alignSelf` allows us to do! Notice it begins with *align*, so just like `alignItems`, it's going to position itself along the Cross Axis. It also has the exact same options as `alignItems` (`flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`).

The code to implement the image above is:

```js
class FlexboxExamples extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
        <View style={[styles.box, {alignSelf: 'flex-end'}]}/>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})

export default FlexboxExamples;
```

Note that all we've done is add `alignSelf: flex-end` to the second child element and that overrode what it was instructed to do by the parent (`alignItems: 'center'`).

If you've made it all the way through this, great work! I realize  that was a lot to cover but I hope it's helped you get up and running  with styling (and specifically flexbox) on React Native.



### Quiz Question

Consider the following CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  align-items: flex-start;
  /* etc. */
}
```

How should we expect items nested in this parent container to render? Please check all that apply.

> With flexbox, we have full control over layout, especially with varying screen sizes.

## Summary

React Native leverages a version of **flexbox** to build component layout. This is primarily due to flexbox's ability to provide consistent layouts across different screen sizes. 

Flexbox containers comprise of two axes: a **main axis**, as well as a **cross axis**. Some of the more critical properties to consider when building layouts with flexbox include `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`. React Native's implementation of flexbox _is_ a bit different, however. We'll see just how in the very next section!
