# Project Instructions & Rubric



# Project Instructions

- Install `create-react-native-app` if you [haven't already](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
- Create a new React Native project: `create-react-native-app mobile-flashcards`
- Build your native app.
- Refer *regularly* to the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1021/view). This is your source of truth for the project specification.

#### Having trouble setting up your local development environment?

Don't get discouraged! Try building your project in an [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io)üçé. In order to submit the project, just download the zip file and submit that file.

### Before submitting, please verify that your project:

- Meets all of the specification outlined in the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1021/view).
- Verify your project adheres to our [HTML](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html), [CSS](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html), [JavaScript](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html), and [Git](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) style guidelines.



# Sample Project

We encourage you to get creative with your projects by adding  additional functionality and/or styling (after you've ensured that the  project meets all of the specifications in the rubric)! Here's an  example:
