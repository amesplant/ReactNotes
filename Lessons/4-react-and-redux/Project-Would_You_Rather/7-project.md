## Project Submission

Due at: Tue, Mar 31 3:00 pm

## Step 1

Before submitting, please verify that your project:

1. Meets specification according to the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view).
2. Includes all of the files necessary to install and launch your web  application on a local web server. For files that include JSX, please  refrain from using the `.jsx` extension (you can prefer `.js`). You can assume that your reviewer will have npm installed on their machine.
3. Adheres to our [HTML](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html), [CSS](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html), [JavaScript](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html), and [Git](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) style guidelines.

## Step 2

If you choose to develop your project in your Workspace, you can  submit directly from your Workspace. When you're ready to submit, just  click the "Submit Project" button.

If you choose to develop on your local machine, you will need to:

1. Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch.
2. On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub"
3. Select the repository for this project (you may need to connect your GitHub account first).
