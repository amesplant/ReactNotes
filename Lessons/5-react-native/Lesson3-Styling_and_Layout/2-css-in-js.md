## CSS in JS

Before we jump into how CSS in JavaScript works, let's check out an example of some "normal" HTML and CSS:

```html
<!-- index.css -->
.avatar {
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin: 10px;
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;
}

<!-- // index.html -->
<div>
  <img class='avatar' src='https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png' />
</div>
```

Nothing too surprising! But since we're not using HTML or CSS files  to build mobile apps -- how would this look in React Native? 

First, it's important to know that all of the core components in React Native can accept a prop named `style`. One way we can leverage this prop is to provide styling to components with inline JavaScript objects:

```js
function Avatar ({ src }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Image
        style={{borderRadius: 5, margin: 10, width: 48, height: 48}}
        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

In the example above, the `` component receives two props: `style` and `source`. The value of `style` is just a plain old JavaScript object with `borderRadius`, `margin`, `width`, and `height` properties. Keep in mind that unlike CSS on the web, properties are written in camelCase (i.e., `borderRadius` in CSS in JS, but `border-radius` on the web).

This works, but things can get muddy quickly. Imagine if the inline  object contained a dozen properties, or if we wanted the same style to  apply to more than just one component! One way to keep your code DRY and reusable is to store the object in a variable:

```js
const styles = {
  image: {
    borderRadius: 5,
    margin: 10,
    width: 48,
    height: 48
  }
};

function Avatar ({ src }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Image
        style={styles.image}
        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

It's a great way to clean things up a bit, but React Native goes a step further with its `StyleSheet` API. Check out the following example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class TextExample extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text style={styles.greenLarge}>This is large green text!</Text>
        <Text style={styles.red}>This is smaller red text!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  greenLarge: {
    color: 'green',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: 40
  },
  red: {
    color: 'red',
    padding: 30
  },
});
```

Here, an object containing styles is passed into `StyleSheet`'s `create` method. It looks similar to styling with a JavaScript object variable! However, using `StyleSheet` gives us a few benefits in terms of code quality and performance. Weâ€™ll take a closer look later in this Lesson as well, but this is how the  React Native docs describe it:

> Code quality
>
> - By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code easier to understand.
> - Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low-level components in the render function.
>
> Performance
>
> - Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer  to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every time.
> - It also allows to send the style only once through the bridge. All  subsequent uses are going to refer to an id (not implemented yet).

Another benefit is that `StyleSheet` validates the content within the style object as well. This means that should there be any  errors in any properties or values in your style objects, the console  will throw an error during compilation instead of at runtime.

> ## ðŸ’¡ Additional StylingðŸ’¡
>
> If you wanted to implement more than one style to a component, the `style` prop can accept styles as an array:
>
> ```js
> <Text style={[styles.red, styles.greenLarge]}>This will be red, then greenLarge</Text>
> ```
>
> The above `` component will render large green text, as the last style in the array will take precedence. This is a  great way to inherit styles!

> ## ðŸ’¡ Libraries for CSS in JSðŸ’¡
>
> Styling in React is going through a renaissance period right now just as Flux did a few years ago (which eventually gave us Redux). There are many different styling libraries popping up and each has different  tradeoffs. Two of the most popular are [Glamorous](https://github.com/robinpowered/glamorous-native) and [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). The whole idea behind both of these libraries is that styling is a  primary concern of the component, and therefore styling should be  coupled with the component itself. We'll take a look at using Styled  Component with React Native a little bit later.



## Summary

CSS in JS is a distinct approach to styling. The main idea is that  styling is handled by JavaScript objects rather than traditional CSS.  Styles can be written inline or accessed via object variables, but React Native offers a `StyleSheet` API that provides a performant and compositional way to style components. 

Now that we've seen React Native handle *styling*, how do we manage the *layout* of a mobile application? We'll take a look at CSS's **flexbox** in the next section to do just that!
