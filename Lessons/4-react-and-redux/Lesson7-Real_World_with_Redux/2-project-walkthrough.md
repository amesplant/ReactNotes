# 2. Project Walkthrough

To help you solidify your understanding of React and Redux, we will  do a project walkthrough. The project we'll be building is called  “Chirper”. Building this simple Twitter clone will help you practice  improving the predictability of an application's state; establishing  strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and  identifying what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components. 

As with most things, there is more than one correct way to achieve a  successful result. We will be discussing one approach to building a  React/Redux project. We encourage you to come up with an approach that  works for you. Regardless of the approach you choose, make sure always  to plan out your project's architecture *before* starting to code. 



# The Importance of Planning Your Project

Many developers make the mistake of starting to code before they've  put any thought into figuring out precisely what their app's  architecture should be. This approach results in spending an incredible  amount of time debugging, restructuring the code, and sometimes even  starting over, completely!

Trust us, planning out your project before starting to code will save you a *lot* of time later on.

In our Chirper project walkthrough, we'll go over the planning stages as well as the coding stages of the project. 



# Planning Your React/Redux App's Architecture

In the Planning Stage, we will go over 4 steps that will help you  come up with your app's architecture, which is often the trickiest part. 

## A Guide for the Planning Stages of Your Project

1. Identify What Each View Should Look Like
2. Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components
3. Determine What Events Happen in the App
4. Determine What Data Lives in the Store



# Coding in Stages

We'll be building the project along together, breaking down each  phase of the project's development. The first thing we we'll do is take a look at the different views the final project should have.
