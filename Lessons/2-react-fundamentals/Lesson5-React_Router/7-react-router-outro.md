## Further Learning

If you're interested in learning more about React Router, we recommend these two resources. First, [Build your own React Router v4](https://tylermcginnis.com/build-your-own-react-router-v4/) will walk through how to implement your own mini version of React  Router to better understand its implementation details. Next, is React  Training's [official documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy) for React Router. Feel free to also check out Tyler McGinnis's [React Router](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-router/) course as well!



#### Lesson Challenge

Read Tyler's [Nested routes with React Router v4](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-nested-routes/) blog post and answer the following questions. Share your answers with your classmates.

1) What is the difference between `Link` and `Route`?

2) What is the difference between `match.path` and `match.url`? Give a use case for each.

3) Create a code example where you (1) pass props to a component that's rendered by React Router and (2) use nested routes.
