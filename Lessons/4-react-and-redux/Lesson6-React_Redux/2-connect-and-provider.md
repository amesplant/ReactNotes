## Getting the Store to Each Component

The first thing we want to do is improve how each component gets  access to the store. If it's tough for a component to access the store,  whether it's to get the state, listen to the state, or update the state, nothing else we do will matter. Right now weâ€™re just passing the store  down as a prop. It works fine enough in our small app, but what if we  had a larger app with more layers to it? Passing the store down ten  components deep wouldn't scale very well. One of the main points of  having a store is to avoid passing props down through a bunch of  components. 

One reason React (talking about *React* for a moment, not *Redux*) is so popular is because it's very efficient. It's efficient in keeping state localized to a component, it's efficient in keeping UI confined  to a component, and it's efficient in knowing when something has changed and re-rendering just that component. So the second thing we need need  to figure out is how to re-render components only if the data they  depend on (from the store) changes. Right now, we're solving this by  calling `getState` at the root of our application and then passing the data down. Again, this won't scale well as our app grows.

If we can find a nice abstraction for getting the store to any  component that needs it and only re-rendering components when the exact  data they need change, we'll improve every aspect of our current  codebase.

# Context

Before we add the `Context` API into our app, let's make sure we're on the same page as to how it all works.

Recall that in one of the previous screencasts, passing data from one component to another component was a bit cumbersome. We had to pass  data from component to component: 

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

function Parent ({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent</h1>
      <Child name={name}/>
    </div>
  );
}

function Child ({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Child</h1>
      <Grandchild name={name}/>
    </div>
  );
}

function Grandchild ({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Grandchild</h1>
      <h3>Name: {name}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const name = 'Tyler';

    return (
      <Parent />
    );
  }
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

The `App` component renders `Parent`, which renders `Child`, which renders `Grandchild`. However, what's important to notice here is that the `Grandchild` component wants to render `name` -- but the data for `name` lives inside the `App` component.

Because `Grandchild` is so deeply nested, we have to pass the `name` prop one-by-one from `App` through all the components until it reaches `Grandchild`. What's more: we must do this even if any of the components along the way (`Parent` and `Child`) aren't even concerned with the `name` data! 

This process of "threading props" to send data to a child component  can be tiresome, and perhaps even error-prone. Luckily, we can avoid it  with React's `Context` API. To begin, we'll use React's `createContext()` function to return an object with a `Provider` as well as a `Consumer`.

```js
const Context = React.createContext();
```

Let's now check out how `Context.Provider` and `Context.Consumer` make these interactions between components possible!

## Context.Provider

The `Provider` component is used in the upper level of the component tree; that is, the component from which the data to be passed is held. In our case, this was the `App` component. We passed the `name` data as the value of `Provider`'s `value` prop:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
  const name = 'Tyler';

  return (
    <Context.Provider value={name}>
      <Parent />
    </Context.Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

Note that the `Provider` component simply wraps around the entire component to be rendered!

## Context.Consumer

On the receiving end (i.e., a component "under" the `Provider` in the component hierarchy), we use the `Consumer` component. In our example, we passed `Consumer` a function as a child. This function accepts a value and returns some JSX:

```js
function Grandchild ({ name }) {
  return (
    <Context.Consumer>
      {(name) => (
      <div>
      <h1>Grandchild</h1>
      <h3>Name: {name}</h3>
      </div>
      )}
    </Context.Consumer>
  );
}
```

As a result, we were able to render the `Grandchild` component with the correct `name` data without ever having to pass that data down the entire component  thread! That's a lot less code than the previous way we had to do it. So React's `Context` API provides a terse, approachable way to easily communicate information from one component to another.

Now, let's go ahead and utilize `Context` in our todos app.

In the previous video, I said both "Connected component" as well as  "Container Component". These are different names that really mean the  same thing - a component that is connected to the store. This is in  contrast to a component that is *just* responsible for rendering  UI content. We call these "Presentation Components". There are other  names for a "Presentational Component", too.

The point of these names are to help explain what the purpose of the component is for:

- A connected component is connected to the Redux store and is responsible for getting data from the store.
- A presentational component should not access the store. It should  receive any information it needs as props and then just render a UI.

Dan Abramov (the creator of Redux!) wrote a post about this very thing. Check it out if to get his take on these concepts: [Presentational and Container Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)



##### Why don't you try converting some of the components to using Context?

We just built out the `Provider`, `Context`, and `connect()` function. This function is so common that it has been developed into a library called [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) that's officially supported by React.

We'll be adding the react-redux library in the following video:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-redux@5.0.6/dist/react-redux.min.js"></script>
```

# The `react-redux` Bindings

Let's take a moment to recap the changes we've made to our app in this Lesson, because we've updated quite a bit!

Previously, we leveraged the standard `redux` library to build our app. This allowed us to create a Redux `store` with the `createStore()` function, giving us an API to listen (`subscribe()`), get updates (`getState()`), and make updates (`dispatch()`) to state. We then created our own `Provider` component to efficiently pass the store to components that needed it, as well as our own `connect()` function so that our components can access "slices" of state as `props`.

We can build a fully-functional React and Redux app without `Provider` or `connect()`, but since they greatly simplify how React components interact with the Redux store, the creators of `redux` have included them in the `react-redux` package!

## `Provider`

With `react-redux`, rather than creating and using our own `Provider` which looks like this:

```js
const Context = React.createContext()    

class Provider extends React.Component {    
  render () {    
  return (    
    <Context.Provider value={this.props.store}>    
      {this.props.children}    
    </Context.Provider>    
    );
  }    
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
  <ConnectedApp />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

...we can simply use the `Provider` component defined by the `react-redux` package! This allows us to wrap our entire app with `Provider`, effectively passing the store to even the most deeply nested components.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
 <ReactRedux.Provider store={store}>
 <ConnectedApp />
 </ReactRedux.Provider>,
 document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## `connect()`

Similarly, we can also leverage `react-redux`'s `connect()` function right out of the box. `connect()` is a higher-order function that takes in two arguments (as well as a few [optional arguments](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options)) and *returns a function*. Check out its signature below:

```js
const buildConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps);
```

What's vital to understand is that `buildConnectedComponent` is a function. `buildConnectedComponent` will take a regular (presentational) React component and return a new, "connected" component. 

```js
const ConnectedComponent = buildConnectedComponent(MyComponent);
```

`ConnectedComponent` renders `MyComponent`, passing it the `props` as defined by `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToPros`.

We can avoid having the intermediary `buildConnectedComponent` variable and just call the functions back-to-back:

```js
const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)
```

Notice the double set of parentheses!

# Summary

React often leverages Redux for more predictable state management via the `react-redux` bindings. These bindings give us an API that simplifies the most common interactions between React and Redux.

`Provider` makes it possible for Redux to pass data from the store to any React components that need it. It uses Reactâ€™s [context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) feature to make this work.

`connect()` connects a React component to the Redux store. The `mapStateToProps()` function allows us to specify which state from the store you want passed to your React component, while the `mapDispatchToProps()` function allows us to bind dispatch to action creators before they ever hit the component.
