Welcome to the course on Redux! There's no doubt that Redux and the Redux  ecosystem is a powerful skill to have in your arsenal. However, it is  not a topic for beginners and can be a daunting area to break into.  We've broken down your path to learning Redux into the following  lessons:

- Lesson 1 - Managing State
- Lesson 2 - UI + Redux
- Lesson 3 - Redux Middleware
- Lesson 4 - Redux with React
- Lesson 5 - Asynchronous Redux
- Lesson 6 - react-redux
- Lesson 7 - Real World Redux

### Lesson 1 - Managing State

You’ll learn techniques to make your state more predictable by moving your state to a central location and establishing strict rules for  getting, listening, and updating that state.

### Lesson 2 - UI + Redux

You’ll learn to move away from having state live in the DOM by  creating a vanilla JavaScript application whose state is managed  entirely by Redux.

### Lesson 3 - Redux Middleware

You’ll learn to create custom middleware and add it to your Redux  store. This middleware will allow you to enhance your store by hooking  into and intercepting actions before they reach any reducers.

### Lesson 4 - Redux with React

You’ll learn how to add React to a Redux application and have the state of that application be managed by Redux.

### Lesson 5 - Asynchronous Redux

You’ll learn to better abstract asynchronous events by creating your own custom Thunk middleware and adding it to your store.

### Lesson 6 - react-redux

You’ll learn to leverage the react-redux bindings in order to  leverage the benefits of a UI library like React and a state management  library like Redux.

### Lesson 7 - Real World Redux

You’ll take your knowledge of Redux and utilize it by building a real world Redux application. You’ll also learn advanced Redux topics like  reducer composition and normalization.
