## Route Component Recap

The main takeaway from this section is that with a `Route` component if you want to be able to pass props to a specific component that the router is going to render, you'll need to use `Route`â€™s `render` prop. As you saw, `render` puts you in charge of rendering the component which in turn allows you  to pass any props to the rendered component as you'd like.

In summary, the `Route` component is a critical piece of  building an application with React Router because it's the component  which is going to decide which components are rendered based on the  current URL path.
